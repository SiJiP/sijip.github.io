                    <h3>Acoustic</h3>
                    <p>An acoustic guitar is a guitar that produces sound acoustically by transmitting the vibration of
                        the strings to the air—as opposed to relying on electronic amplification (see electric guitar).
                        The sound waves from the strings of an acoustic guitar resonate through the guitar's body,
                        creating sound. This typically involves the use of a sound board and a sound box to strengthen
                        the vibrations of the strings. In standard tuning the guitar's six strings are tuned (low to
                        high) E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4.

                        Guitar strings may be plucked individually with a pick or fingertip, or strummed to play chords.
                        Plucking a string causes it to vibrate at a fundamental pitch determined by the string's length,
                        mass, and tension. (Overtones are also present, closely related to harmonics of the fundamental
                        pitch.) The string causes the soundboard and the air enclosed by the sound box to vibrate. As
                        these have their own resonances, they amplify some overtones more strongly than others,
                        affecting the timbre of the resulting sound. </p>

                <article id="Classical" class="tabcontent">
                    <h3>Classical</h3>
                    <p>The classical guitar (also known as the nylon-string guitar or Spanish guitar) is a member of the
                        guitar family used in classical music. An acoustic wooden string instrument with strings made of
                        gut or nylon, it is a precursor of the acoustic and electric guitars which use metal strings.
                        The name guitar comes from Persian language, in which Tar means string. Tar (string instrument)
                        is also the name of an Iranian instrument that could be the primary form of guitar. Classical
                        guitars are derived from the Spanish vihuela and gittern in the fifteenth and sixteenth century,
                        which later evolved into the seventeenth and eighteenth century Baroque guitar and later the
                        modern classical guitar in the mid nineteenth century.

                        For a right-handed player, the traditional classical guitar has twelve frets clear of the body
                        and is properly held on the left leg, so that the hand that plucks or strums the strings does so
                        near the back of the sound hole (this is called the classical position). The modern steel string
                        guitar, on the other hand, usually has fourteen frets clear of the body (see Dreadnought) and is
                        commonly played off the hip. </p>

                <article id="Electric" class="tabcontent">
                    <h3>Electric</h3>
                    <p>An electric guitar is a guitar that uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its
                        strings into electrical signals. The vibration occurs when a guitar player strums, plucks,
                        fingerpicks, slaps or taps the strings. The pickup generally uses electromagnetic induction to
                        create this signal, which being relatively weak is fed into a guitar amplifier before being sent
                        to the speaker(s), which converts it into audible sound.

                        The electric signal can be electronically altered to change the timbre of the sound. Often, the
                        signal is modified using effects such as reverb, distortion and "overdrive"; the latter is
                        considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and rock guitar playing. </p>

                <article id="Ukulele" class="tabcontent">
                    <h3>Ukulele</h3>
                    <p>The ukulele (from Hawaiian: ʻukulele [ˈukuˈlɛlɛ], approximately
                        OO-koo-LEH-leh) or ukelele is a member of the guitar family of instruments. It generally
                        employs four nylon or gut strings or four courses of strings. Some strings may be paired
                        in courses, giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings.

                        The ukulele originated in the 19th century as a Hawaiian adaptation of the Portuguese
                        machete,[4] a small guitar-like instrument, which was introduced to Hawaii by Portuguese
                        immigrants, mainly from Madeira and the Azores. It gained great popularity elsewhere in the
                        United States during the early 20th century and from there spread internationally.

                        The tone and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction. Ukuleles commonly come in
                        four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone.
